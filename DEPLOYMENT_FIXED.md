# Deployment Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. Hardcoded Supabase Credentials
**Issue:** The Supabase client file had hardcoded credentials that didn't use environment variables.

**Fixed:** Updated `/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` to properly use environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` from `.env`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from `.env`
- Added validation to throw clear errors if environment variables are missing

### 2. Build Configuration Issue
**Issue:** The Vite build configuration had aggressive tree-shaking and manual chunk splitting that caused the entire application code to be removed, resulting in empty bundles (only 711 bytes).

**Fixed:** Simplified the build configuration in `vite.config.ts`:
- Removed problematic `treeshake` settings that were too aggressive
- Removed manual chunk splitting function that caused empty chunks
- Build now produces proper bundles (~805KB main bundle)

## Build Verification

The build is now working correctly:
- Main bundle: `index-R3WAPqET.js` (805KB)
- CSS bundle: `index-CJ7NuGfj.css` (94KB)
- Code-split route bundles for lazy-loaded pages
- Service worker and PWA manifest generated

## Next Steps for Deployment

### Step 1: Push Changes to Git Repository

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues: update Supabase client and build config"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables on Your Deployment Platform

#### For Vercel:
1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJib2x0IiwicmVmIjoiMGVjOTBiNTdkNmU5NWZjYmRhMTk4MzJmIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTg4ODE1NzQsImV4cCI6MTc1ODg4MTU3NH0.9I8-U0x86Ak8t2DGaIk0HfvTSLsAyzdnz-Nw00mMkKw
```

4. Click **Save**
5. Go to **Deployments** tab
6. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment

#### For Netlify:
1. Go to your site dashboard on Netlify
2. Click **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
3. Click **Add a variable** and add the same variables as above
4. Click **Save**
5. Go to **Deploys** tab
6. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

After redeployment, check:
1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Check Console tab - should see no errors
4. Check Network tab - main JS bundle should be ~805KB
5. Try navigating between pages
6. Test if the site loads and displays correctly

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache (If Needed)

If you visited your deployed site before the fix and it's still not showing:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Chrome/Edge: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`, select "Cached images and files", click Clear
   - Firefox: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`, select "Cache", click Clear
   - Safari: Press `Cmd+Option+E`

2. **Hard refresh:**
   - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Ctrl+F5`
   - Mac: `Cmd+Shift+R`

3. **Unregister service worker:**
   - Open DevTools → Application tab → Service Workers
   - Click "Unregister" next to any registered service workers
   - Refresh the page

### Step 5: Update Supabase Settings (Important!)

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
4. Update **Site URL** to your deployed domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
5. Add to **Redirect URLs**:
   - `https://yourdomain.com/**`
   - `https://www.yourdomain.com/**`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Missing VITE_SUPABASE_URL environment variable"
**Solution:** Environment variables not set on deployment platform. Follow Step 2 above.

### Issue: Page shows blank screen
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Clear browser cache and service worker
4. Verify DNS is pointing to correct deployment

### Issue: Old version still showing
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Unregister service worker (DevTools → Application → Service Workers)
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: 404 on page refresh
**Solution:** Already handled by `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml` - these files configure rewrites for single-page application routing.

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Home page loads
- [ ] Can navigate to Services page
- [ ] Can navigate to Pricing page
- [ ] Can navigate to About page
- [ ] Can navigate to Customer Login
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] CSS styles are loading correctly

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure DNS propagation is complete (can take up to 48 hours)
4. Try accessing the site from an incognito/private window
5. Verify the deployment build logs for any errors
