# üö® URGENT: Fix Your Site Access Issue

## The Problem

Your site cannot be accessed because your **Supabase ANON key has expired**. This is blocking your entire application from loading.

## ‚ö° Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get New Supabase Credentials (2 minutes)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com
   - Log in to your account

2. **Get Your Project Credentials:**
   - Click on your project (or create new project if needed)
   - Click **Settings** (gear icon in sidebar)
   - Click **API**
   - You'll see two values you need:

   ```
   Project URL: https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   anon public: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

### Step 2: Update Your .env File (1 minute)

**Replace the values in your `.env` file:**

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR-NEW-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.YOUR-NEW-KEY-HERE
```

**CRITICAL:** Make sure you copy the ENTIRE anon key (it's very long, starts with `eyJ` and is about 200+ characters)

### Step 3: Rebuild Your Project (2 minutes)

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clean old build
rm -rf dist

# Rebuild with new credentials

## üéØ Most Common Mistake

**Not copying the ENTIRE anon key!**

The anon key is VERY long (200+ characters). Make sure you copy all of it:
- It starts with: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.`
- It has two dots (.) in it
- It's about 15-20 lines long if you paste it in a text editor
- Don't add any spaces or line breaks

**Your site should be accessible within 5 minutes of completing these steps!**
