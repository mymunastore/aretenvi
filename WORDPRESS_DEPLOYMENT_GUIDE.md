## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables

Your React app was built with environment variables already compiled in. If you need to update them:

1. Update your local `.env` file
2. Run `npm run build` again
3. Copy new files from `dist/` to `react-wp-theme/react-app/`
4. Re-upload the theme

### Supabase CORS Settings

Make sure your WordPress domain is allowed in Supabase:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "API"
4. Under "CORS Allowed Origins", add:
   - `https://yourdomain.com`
   - `https://www.yourdomain.com`

### File Structure

```
react-wp-theme/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css              ‚Üê WordPress theme metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functions.php          ‚Üê Enqueues your React assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php              ‚Üê Main template (renders <div id="root">)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ header.php             ‚Üê Includes wp_head()
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ footer.php             ‚Üê Includes wp_footer()

    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index-e_LptW6c.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.webmanifest
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ registerSW.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sw.js
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other build files]
```

## üîß WordPress Integration Features

Your React app now has access to WordPress data via `window.wpData`:

```javascript
window.wpData = {
  restUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/',
  homeUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/',
  siteUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com',
  siteName: 'Your Site Name',
  siteDesc: 'Your Site Description',
  themeUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/wp-content/themes/react-wp-theme',
  ajaxUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php',
  nonce: 'wp_rest_nonce_value',
  isLoggedIn: false,
  currentUser: 0
}
```

You can use this to fetch WordPress content:

```javascript
// Example: Fetch posts from WordPress
const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${window.wpData.restUrl}wp/v2/posts`);
  const posts = await response.json();
  return posts;
};
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### White Screen After Activation

**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Usually means:
- Asset files not loaded correctly
- File paths incorrect in `functions.php`
- JavaScript error in React app

### 404 on React Routes

**Solution:** Add to `.htaccess` in WordPress root:
```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

### CSS Not Loading

**Solutions:**
1. Clear WordPress cache (if using cache plugin)
2. Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. Check file permissions: Files should be 644, folders 755
4. Verify asset files exist in theme folder

### Supabase Not Connecting

**Solutions:**
1. Add WordPress domain to Supabase CORS settings
2. Check environment variables were included in build
3. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
4. Check browser console for specific errors

## üìã Pre-Upload Checklist

Before uploading, verify:

- [ ] Theme folder is named `react-wp-theme`
- [ ] All PHP files exist (style.css, functions.php, index.php, header.php, footer.php)
- [ ] React build files are in `react-app/` folder
- [ ] Asset files exist in `react-app/assets/`
- [ ] File names in `functions.php` match actual build files
- [ ] ZIP file is properly created (if using upload method)

## üéØ Next Steps After Activation

1. **Test All Routes:** Navigate through your React app routes
2. **Test Mobile:** Check responsive design works
3. **Test PWA:** Try "Add to Home Screen" on mobile
4. **Test Forms:** Verify form submissions work
5. **Check Performance:** Use Google PageSpeed Insights
6. **Set Up SSL:** Ensure HTTPS is enabled (most hosts provide free SSL)
7. **Configure Caching:** Install a WordPress cache plugin for better performance
8. **Backup:** Set up automatic backups of your WordPress site

## üîÑ Updating Your Theme

When you make changes to your React app:

1. Update React code locally
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Copy `dist/*` to `react-wp-theme/react-app/`
4. Update file names in `functions.php` if hashes changed
5. Re-upload theme to WordPress
