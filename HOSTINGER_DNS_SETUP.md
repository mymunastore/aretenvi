## For Vercel Deployment

### What DNS Records to Add

After you add your domain in Vercel, you'll get specific values. Here's what you need to configure:

#### A Record (for root domain)

**Before:**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or blank)
Points to: [old IP address]
```

**After (using Vercel's IP):**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or blank)
Points to: 76.76.21.21 (example - use actual IP from Vercel)
TTL: 3600
```

#### CNAME Record (for www subdomain)

**Add new or update existing:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Points to: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 3600
```

### How to Update in Hostinger

1. **Delete or Edit the existing A record:**
   - Find the A record with Name: @ or blank
   - Click the **trash icon** or **Edit**
   - If editing, change the IP to Vercel's IP
   - If deleting, click **Add Record** to create new one

2. **Add/Update CNAME record:**
   - Find existing CNAME with Name: www (if any)
   - Click **Edit** or **Add Record**
   - Set Type: CNAME
   - Set Name: www
   - Set Points to: cname.vercel-dns.com
   - Click **Save**

3. **Remove conflicting records:**
   - If you see an A record for "www", delete it (CNAME should be used instead)
   - Remove any old CNAME records pointing to other services

## For Netlify Deployment

### What DNS Records to Add

#### Option A: Using Netlify DNS Records (Recommended)

**A Record:**
```
Type: A
Name: @ (or blank)
Points to: 75.2.60.5 (example - use actual IP from Netlify)
TTL: 3600
```

**CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Points to: [your-site-name].netlify.app
TTL: 3600
```

#### Option B: Using Netlify DNS Hosting (Easiest)

Netlify can manage your entire DNS:

1. In Netlify, go to **Domain settings** â†’ **DNS**
2. Choose **Use Netlify DNS**
3. Netlify will provide you with nameservers (e.g., dns1.p01.nsone.net)
4. In Hostinger:
   - Go to **Domain** â†’ **DNS / Name Servers**
   - Click **Change Nameservers**
   - Select **Custom nameservers**
   - Enter the nameservers provided by Netlify
   - Click **Save**

**Note:** Using Netlify DNS means all DNS management moves to Netlify.

## Important Notes

### DNS Propagation Time

- **Typical time:** 15-30 minutes
- **Maximum time:** Up to 48 hours
- **Check progress:** Use [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)

During propagation:
- Some people may see old site, some see new
- This is normal and will resolve automatically
- Don't make additional changes while waiting

### TTL (Time To Live)

- **What it is:** How long DNS servers cache your records
- **Recommended value:** 3600 (1 hour)
- **Lower value (300):** Faster updates, more queries
- **Higher value (86400):** Slower updates, fewer queries

### Record Priority

If you have multiple A records, delete extras:
- Keep only ONE A record for @ (root domain)
- Keep only ONE CNAME for www

### Email Hosting

**IMPORTANT:** If you use Hostinger for email (e.g., contact@yourdomain.com), keep these records:

- **MX records** - For email delivery
- **TXT records** - For SPF, DKIM (email authentication)

Do NOT delete these! Only modify A and CNAME records.

## Visual Guide: What Records Should Look Like

### Final DNS Records (Vercel Example)

```
Type    | Name  | Points to                      | TTL
--------|-------|--------------------------------|------
A       | @     | 76.76.21.21                    | 3600
CNAME   | www   | cname.vercel-dns.com           | 3600
MX      | @     | mx1.hostinger.com (priority 10)| 3600
TXT     | @     | v=spf1 include:hostinger.com   | 3600
```

### Final DNS Records (Netlify Example)

```
Type    | Name  | Points to                      | TTL
--------|-------|--------------------------------|------
A       | @     | 75.2.60.5                      | 3600
CNAME   | www   | yoursite.netlify.app           | 3600
MX      | @     | mx1.hostinger.com (priority 10)| 3600
TXT     | @     | v=spf1 include:hostinger.com   | 3600
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check DNS Records

Use online tools to verify your changes:
- [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) - Global DNS propagation
- [mxtoolbox.com](https://mxtoolbox.com) - Detailed DNS lookup
- Command line: `nslookup yourdomain.com`

### 2. Test Your Domain

After DNS propagates:
1. Open incognito/private browser window
2. Visit `http://yourdomain.com`
3. Should redirect to `https://yourdomain.com`
4. Visit `http://www.yourdomain.com`
5. Should redirect to `https://yourdomain.com` (or www version)

### 3. Check SSL Certificate

- Look for green padlock in browser
- Click padlock â†’ Certificate should show "Let's Encrypt" or "Vercel"
- Certificate should be valid and not expired

## Troubleshooting

### "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN" Error

**Cause:** Domain not resolving
**Fix:**
1. Verify A record exists with @ for name
2. Check DNS propagation status
3. Wait longer (up to 48 hours)
4. Clear browser DNS cache

### "This site can't be reached" Error

**Cause:** Wrong IP address or records not saved
**Fix:**
1. Verify IP address matches exactly from Vercel/Netlify
2. Check records were actually saved in Hostinger
3. Try with www prefix: `www.yourdomain.com`

### WWW vs Non-WWW Issues

**Both should work**, but one should redirect to the other:

**If you prefer non-www (yourdomain.com):**
- Set this as primary in Vercel/Netlify settings
- CNAME for www will auto-redirect to non-www

**If you prefer www (www.yourdomain.com):**
- Set this as primary in Vercel/Netlify settings
- A record will redirect to www

### SSL Certificate Not Showing

**Cause:** DNS not fully propagated or cert not issued yet
**Fix:**
1. Wait 30-60 minutes after DNS propagation
2. Check domain status in Vercel/Netlify dashboard
3. Try accessing with https:// explicitly
4. Contact Vercel/Netlify support if issue persists

### Changes Not Reflecting

**Cause:** DNS caching
**Fix:**
1. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
2. Try incognito mode
3. Try different browser
4. Try different device/network
5. Flush DNS cache:
   - Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
   - Mac: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`
   - Linux: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`
