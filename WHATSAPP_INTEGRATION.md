## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Customer clicks WhatsApp link** (from button, contact section, or footer)
2. **WhatsApp opens automatically**:
   - On mobile: Opens WhatsApp app
   - On desktop: Opens WhatsApp Web
3. **Pre-filled message appears** in the chat input
4. **Customer can edit or send** the message immediately
5. **Your team receives the message** and can respond in real-time

### Technical Implementation

All WhatsApp links use the standard WhatsApp URL format:
```
https://wa.me/[PHONE_NUMBER]?text=[ENCODED_MESSAGE]
```

Example:
```
https://wa.me/2349152870616?text=Hello!%20I'm%20interested%20in%20ARET%20Environmental%20Services...
```

**Note**: Phone number format uses international format without the "+" symbol (2349152870616)

## Customer Care Considerations

### Responding to WhatsApp Messages

When customers contact via WhatsApp:

1. **Acknowledge quickly** - Respond within 5 minutes if possible
2. **Identify their needs** - Ask clarifying questions about services needed
3. **Collect information** - Gather:
   - Full name
   - Email address
   - Phone number (if different)
   - Service type needed
   - Property type
   - Location/address
   - Preferred contact time
   - Any special requirements

4. **Provide quote** - Give pricing information
5. **Schedule service** - Confirm date and time
6. **Send confirmation** - Follow up with written confirmation via WhatsApp

### Best Practices

- Use WhatsApp Business App for professional features:
  - Automated greeting messages
  - Away messages
  - Quick replies for common questions
  - Labels for organizing contacts
  - Catalog feature for service listings

- Save contact information promptly to your CRM or database
- Use the pre-existing `client_registrations` table in Supabase to store customer data
- Follow up within 24 hours with formal quote or next steps

---

## Database Integration (Optional)

While the WhatsApp integration is direct (not automated), you can still use the Supabase database to store client information collected through WhatsApp conversations.

### Client Registrations Table

The database includes a `client_registrations` table that can be used to manually log client information:

**Structure**:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `reference_number` - Generated reference (e.g., ARET20250930001)
- `full_name` - Client's full name
- `email` - Email address
- `phone` - Phone number
- `service_type` - Type of service requested
- `property_type` - Residential/Commercial/Industrial
- `location` - Address in Uyo
- `preferred_contact_time` - Best time to reach them
- `additional_comments` - Special requirements
- `registration_source` - Set to 'whatsapp_manual'
- `status` - pending, contacted, in_progress, completed
- `created_at` - Timestamp

**Manual Entry Process**:
1. Collect information via WhatsApp chat
2. Log in to Supabase Dashboard
3. Navigate to Table Editor â†’ `client_registrations`
4. Click "Insert Row"
5. Fill in the collected information
6. Generate reference number using: `SELECT generate_reference_number();`
7. Set `registration_source` to 'whatsapp_manual'
8. Save the entry

This helps you:
- Track all customer inquiries
- Generate reports on lead sources
- Monitor conversion rates
- Assign clients to team members
- Track status of each inquiry

### Issue: Wrong Number Format

**Symptoms**: Link opens but shows error

**Solution**: Ensure number format is correct:
